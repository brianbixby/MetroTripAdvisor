For this project we used a wide variety of technologies and tools. On the front-end we utilized React, Bootstrap, Google Maps, Javascript, CSS and HTML. On the back end we utilized Express, Postgress and OneBusAway's API.

Congcong has been wanting to create a metro bus route application for a long time and this project was a great opportunity for us to do so. The first step was deciding on the functionality that we wanted the website to give the user and from there we began researching the best methods of accessing the data to provide users with a real application that can be of service in their day to day lives.

The first step was finding an API that we could query and display on the page, One Bus Away was an obvious choice. From this point we integrated Google Maps for data visualization. After this, we worked on displaying all bus stops for each route then we incorporated a rendering of the routes along with a listing of other buses that share stops. Lastly, we added search functionality for users to query particular destinations or landmarks on the map and our application will display all bus stops nearby.
